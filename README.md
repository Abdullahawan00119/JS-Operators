JavaScript Learning Journey
Hi there! ðŸ‘‹ Iâ€™ve recently started learning JavaScript, and this repository is where Iâ€™m documenting everything I learn along the way. I have no background in programming or web development, so this is truly a beginnerâ€™s journey. My goal is to understand how websites work and eventually build my own projects using JavaScript. In this repo, youâ€™ll find my practice exercises, notes, small projects, and any helpful resources I come across. Iâ€™m learning at my own pace, starting with the basics like variables, functions, loops, and slowly moving into more advanced topics like working with the browser, the DOM, and APIs. If you're also new to coding, I hope this can be a helpful and encouraging space. Feel free to follow along, use the code, or share tips â€” Iâ€™m excited to keep learning and improving!
